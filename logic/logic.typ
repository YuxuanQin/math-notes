= Notes for Marker's Introduction to Mathematical Logic

+ A $cal(L)$-theory is a set of $cal(L)$-sentences.
+ A set $S$ of $cal(L)$-structure $M$ is $A$-definable for some set $A subset M$ if there is a formular $f(v, b)$ define $S$, where $b subset A$ is a set of elements in $A$
  - Remark: So a $0$-definable set is a set that define by a formular, which does not referrence to any parameters.
