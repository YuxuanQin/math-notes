== 06-30: $F^times$ is cyclic
For finite field $F$, the multiplicative group $F^times$ is cyclic. This result can be used to prove that every finite field is gained from a quotient like $bold(F)_p [x] \/ (pi (x))$, for some prime $p$ and monic irreducible $pi (x)$.

*Main idea*: a group $G$ is cyclic iff there is an element $g$ such that $h = g^k$ for any other element $h$ and some $k$, so we must have $"ord" g = |G|$. But by Lagrange theorem we alyways have $"ord" g | |G|$ for any $g$ in $G$, so it suffices to prove $|G| <= "ord" g$. Thanks to the lemma below, we have $h^("ord" g) = 1$ for all $h$. So the polynomial $x^("ord" g) = 1$ has $|F^times|$ roots, which implies $|F^times| <= "ord" g$.

*Lemma*: In finite ablian group, the order of every element divides the maximal order. (It's fun to prove)

== 07-05: Compact theorem (by Ultraproduct)
- Ultraproduct: suppose $(A_i)_(i in I)$ is a bunch of structure in language $L$, then we can construct a new structure $cal(A)$ using them, provieded am ultrafilter $ cal(U)$ on $I$:
$ cal(A) := product_cal(U) A_i := (product_(i in I) A_i) \/ ~_cal(U). $

- Los theorem: A formula is ture in an ultraproduct, if and only if this formula is ture in _many_ smaller models which are used to made that ultraproduct. ("many" is defined by the ultrafilter.)
- Proof of Compact theorem: The model you want is the ultraproduct $product_cal(U) A_i$ where $(A_i) _(i in I)$, which is indexed by the set $I$ of all finite sub-theory of given theory $T$, are models of $i in I$ (by assumption these models must exist). To prove all formula $phi$ in $T$ are vaild in that ultraproduct, one consult for Los theorem. (The ultrafilter needed by Los theorem can just be solved out by your desire of "makeing $cal(A)$ a model of $T$".)

A little interesting result: Suppose $cal(U)_A$ is an ultrafilter generated by $A$ on $I$ (thus is priciple), then
$ {cal(U)_A subset B: B "ultrafilter on I"} tilde.eq {V: V "ultrafilter on A"}. $

This can be used to prove every priciple ultrafilter is generated by a singleton in $cal(P)(I)$ i.e., by a single subset of $I$, or equivalentlly, every non-principle ultrafilter must contain the Frechet filter (consists of precisely all "cofinite" subsets of $I$) as a subset.

== 07-06: $CC$ is the ultraproduct of $(overline(FF_p))_(p "prime")$
Do not know why yet. Can not even ensure the correctness, but I think...

== 07-07: $"Ran"_G G$ is a monad if it exists. Category admits arbitrary large limit must be a poset.
This is the construction of socalled *codensity* monad of an arbitrary functor $G: A -> B$, and the monadness can be proved in a clever way:

Define a category $r_G$ whose:
- Objects: $(X: B -> B, x: X G => G)$, i.e., right extensions of $G$;
- Morphisms between $(X, x)$ and $(Y, y)$: Natural transformations $eta: X => Y$ which campatible with $x$ and $y$.

And $(r_G, "id"_B, compose)$ is a (strict) monoidal category.

Then we find *$"Ran"_G G$ is the terminal object in $r_G$*! So by common abstract nonsense argument, it has an unique monoid structure.
