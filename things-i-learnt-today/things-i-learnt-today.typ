== 06-30: $F^times$ is cyclic
For finite field $F$, the multiplicative group $F^times$ is cyclic. This result can be used to prove that every finite field is gained from a quotient like $bold(F)_p [x] \/ (pi (x))$, for some prime $p$ and monic irreducible $pi (x)$.

*Main idea*: a group $G$ is cyclic iff there is an element $g$ such that $h = g^k$ for any other element $h$ and some $k$, so we must have $"ord" g = |G|$. But by Lagrange theorem we alyways have $"ord" g | |G|$ for any $g$ in $G$, so it suffices to prove $|G| <= "ord" g$. Thanks to the lemma below, we have $h^("ord" g) = 1$ for all $h$. So the polynomial $x^("ord" g) = 1$ has $|F^times|$ roots, which implies $|F^times| <= "ord" g$.

*Lemma*: In finite ablian group, the order of every element divides the maximal order. (It's fun to prove)

== 07-05: Compact theorem (by Ultraproduct)
- Ultraproduct: suppose $(A_i)_(i in I)$ is a bunch of structure in language $L$, then we can construct a new structure $cal(A)$ using them, provieded am ultrafilter $ cal(U)$ on $I$:
$ cal(A) := product_cal(U) A_i := (product_(i in I) A_i) \/ ~_cal(U). $

- Los theorem: A formula is ture in an ultraproduct, if and only if this formula is ture in _many_ smaller models which are used to made that ultraproduct. ("many" is defined by the ultrafilter.)
- Proof of Compact theorem: The model you want is the ultraproduct $product_cal(U) A_i$ where $(A_i) _(i in I)$, which is indexed by the set $I$ of all finite sub-theory of given theory $T$, are models of $i in I$ (by assumption these models must exist). To prove all formula $phi$ in $T$ are vaild in that ultraproduct, one consult for Los theorem. (The ultrafilter needed by Los theorem can just be solved out by your desire of "makeing $cal(A)$ a model of $T$".)

A little interesting result: Suppose $cal(U)_A$ is an ultrafilter generated by $A$ on $I$ (thus is priciple), then
$ {cal(U)_A subset B: B "ultrafilter on I"} tilde.eq {V: V "ultrafilter on A"}. $

This can be used to prove every priciple ultrafilter is generated by a singleton in $cal(P)(I)$ i.e., by a single subset of $I$, or equivalentlly, every non-principle ultrafilter must contain the Frechet filter (consists of precisely all "cofinite" subsets of $I$) as a subset.

== 07-06: $CC$ is the ultraproduct of $(overline(FF_p))_(p "prime")$
Do not know why yet. Can not even ensure the correctness, but I think...

== 07-07: $"Ran"_G G$ is a monad if it exists. Category admits arbitrary large limit must be a poset.
This is the construction of socalled *codensity* monad of an arbitrary functor $G: A -> B$, and the monadness can be proved in a clever way:

Define a category $r_G$ whose:
- Objects: $(X: B -> B, x: X G => G)$, i.e., right extensions of $G$;
- Morphisms between $(X, x)$ and $(Y, y)$: Natural transformations $eta: X => Y$ which campatible with $x$ and $y$.

And $(r_G, "id"_B, compose)$ is a (strict) monoidal category.

Then we find: $"Ran"_G G$ is the terminal object in $r_G$! So by common abstract nonsense argument, it has an unique monoid structure.

== 07-12: Adjoint Functor Theorem
In this section we fix a Grothendieck universe $UU$ and all "complete" are intepreted as "$UU$-small complete".

*Adjoint Functor Theorem*: For $G: cal(A) -> cal(X)$ a continuous functor with complete domain $cal(A)$, it has a _left adjoint_ $F: cal(X) -> cal(A)$ if and only if the nutorious solution set condition is satisfied: For all $x in cal(X)$ there is a bunch of objects $a^x_i in cal(A)$ indexed by a small set such that there are a bunch of morphisms $eta^x_i: x -> G a^x_i$ which form a initial class in the comma category $(x arrow.b G)$.

The solution set condition is just a combinition of two _small_ facts:
  + For a _small complete_ category with _small_ hom-sets, a initial class produce the initial object (tricky);
  + The unit of a adjunction $eta: "Id"_(cal(X)) => G F$ is made up of initial objects of comma categories $(x arrow.b G)$ for all $x in cal(X)$ (ordinary observation).

The solution set condition is just the result of applying fact 1 to fact 2. And, as your expectation, $F x := a_x$.

I have a sense that this solution set condition is just a rephrasement of $"Ran"_G "Id"_A$ is a absolute right Kan extension.

*Application*: We now show the existence of free group functor: By the Adjoint Functor Theorem and the well known fact that $bold("Grp")$ is complete, we just need to construct an initial class for each set $S in bold("Set")$. In the following proof, $U: bold("Grp") -> bold("Set")$ is the forgetful functor, we want its right adjoint.

For an arbitrary morphism $g: S -> U H$ where $S$ is a set and $H$ a group, good candidates of the solution set are those subgroups generated by $"im" g$, note that the elements of $angle.l "im" g angle.r$ are all of the form $g(s_1)^alpha g(s_2)^alpha dots.h.c g(s_n)^alpha$ where $alpha = plus.minus 1$ and $s_i$ are not necessarily diffferent, i.e. every element of this generated subgroup is always a finite composition of elements in $"im" g$, so the cardinality of $angle.l "im" g angle.r$ is bounded by $|S| + alef_0$, for any $g$, for any $H$.

Furthur more, the number of group structures on $|S| + alef_0$ is also bounded (by simple estimation). So, by the Axiom of Choice, we choose a group from each isomorphic class of those group structures and gather these representations up and obtain the solution set.

Finally, we get the free group functor.
