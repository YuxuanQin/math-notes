# Math notes

I forget things, so I mark interesting discoveries down.

The contents in each notes are accumulated bit by bit, so these are not standard course notes.

- `algebra`: Notes on Algebra, currently nothing.
- `algebraic-topology`: As the name indicate.
- `category`: Notes on Category Theory, some propositions that I need to see them frequently.
- `manifold`: Things about manifolds.
- `simplicial`: Almost dead.
- `today`: A diary-like notes, a lot of things.
- `Geometric Group Theory`: Notes from Nankai Logic School 2025.

# 数学笔记

我遗忘，我记录。

笔记中的内容并不系统，但的确记录了某些有趣的事实。
